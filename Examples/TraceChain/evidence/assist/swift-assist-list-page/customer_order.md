# Swift Assist — List page `Customer Order`

Use the exact generated entry point and APIs below. The runtime applies the trusted policy to both the rows and the exact total count. Page size is limited to `1...10000`; callers cannot override the runtime hard limit.

```swift
import TeaQLCore

public func listActiveCustomerOrderPage(
    _ context: UserContext,
    offset: Int,
    limit: Int
) async throws -> TeaQLPage<CustomerOrder> {
    try await Q.customerOrdersWithMinimalFields()
        .selectOrderNumber()
        .selectDescription()
        .selectPlatformWith(Q.platformsWithMinimalFields())
        .selectOrderItemList()
        .selectPaymentList()
        .selectShipmentList()
        .orderByIdAscending()
        .comment("what: list the active Customer Order page")
        .purpose("why: serve the authorized Customer Order directory")
        .executeForPage(context, offset: offset, limit: limit)
}
```

Allow-list fields for filter/projection/stable order:
- `id` via its exact generated request API.
- `platform` via its exact generated request API.
- `orderNumber` via its exact generated request API.
- `description` via its exact generated request API.
- `version` via its exact generated request API.

Allow-list generated reverse relation selection:
- `orderItemList` via `.selectOrderItemList()` to `OrderItem`.
- `paymentList` via `.selectPaymentList()` to `Payment`.
- `shipmentList` via `.selectShipmentList()` to `Shipment`.


Compile and execute this source unchanged. Keep the unique ID ordering so adjacent pages cannot overlap. Reject negative offsets, page sizes outside `1...10000`, unknown generated filters/sorts, missing intent, and any attempt to set `hardLimit` from generated client code.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact SWIFT generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `list-page`.

- Validate offset, page size, filters, deep paths, IN-list size, and sort against
  explicit allow-lists. Reject invalid input instead of widening the query.
- Use a stable unique ordering and retain the runtime hard limit. Continuous-page
  optimization is opt-in, browsing-only, local runtime policy and cannot cross TFP.
- Run count only when explicitly requested; otherwise use the returned list length.
