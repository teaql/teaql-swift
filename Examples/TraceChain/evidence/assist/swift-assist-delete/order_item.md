# Swift Assist — Soft delete `Order Item`

Load the current generated value so its stored ID and original optimistic
version participate in deletion. Never construct a mutation or physically
delete a row.

```swift
import TeaQLCore

public func deleteOrderItem(
    _ context: UserContext,
    entityId: Int64
) async throws -> Bool {
    guard var entity = try await Q.orderItems()
        .withIdIs(entityId)
        .comment("what: load current Order Item for soft delete")
        .purpose("why: preserve original version and authorize deletion")
        .executeForList(context)
        .first
    else { return false }

    entity.markForDeletion()
    _ = try await entity
        .auditAs("business reason: soft delete authorized Order Item")
        .save(context)
    return true
}
```

Compile and execute this source unchanged. Prove normal queries hide the row,
`deletedRowsOnly()` retains it with a negative version, an independently loaded
stale copy conflicts, missing rows return false, and missing/blank audit or
invented physical-delete APIs fail.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact SWIFT generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `delete`.

- Load the tenant-scoped current entity and use the generated hard-delete or
  domain-specific soft-delete API; do not invent a deletion method.
- Require an audit reason and optimistic version. Test missing audit and stale
  version as explicit failures.
